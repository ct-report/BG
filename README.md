# BG
Contact Tracing - Bulgaria

![](apkicon_BG.png)

**ViruSafe** developed by Scalefocus. The app was approved by the Bulgarian Ministry of Health on April 4 & published on the Google Play Store on April 7.

It's a multi-purpose app, that doesn't use Bluetooth for tracing, but only GPS location. Besides being an information app about COVID-19 emergency in Bulgaria, such app includes indeed a health status tracker/diary & a location tracker, that allows to share GPS coordinates with the Ministry of Health.

After installation, the first step is a OTP validation via SMS. Then, the user must enter his personal ID or passport number. 

When registered users allow to share their GPS coordinates, server renders infection & risk-area heatmaps.
